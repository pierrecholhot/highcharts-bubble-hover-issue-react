# Highcharts bubble hover issue with create-react-app

I have this issue in a private project, but it's visible when using create-react-app as well.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

Note: I was unable to reproduce this bug in a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/v4veLo4o/1/) but it looks like it's still off by one pixel.
