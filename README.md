# Highcharts bubble hover issue with create-react-app

I have this issue in a private project, but it's visible when using create-react-app as well.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pierrecholhot/highcharts-bubble-hover-issue-react/master/screenshot.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

``` bash
npm install
npm start
```

Note: Unable to reproduce this bug in a fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/v4veLo4o/1/
